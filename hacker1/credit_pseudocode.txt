//  pseudocode for hacker1 pset for CS50 
_______________________________________________________________________________
ask user for credit card number
store this value
verify input is valid
    if true, verify against Luhn's algorithm
        if true, verify starting digits and length match same card provider
                if true, identify and print card provider (AMEX, VISA, MASTERCARD)
                else, print INVALID

/* Notes: 
   1. I feel like this pseudocode should be longer and the real
      code should be shorter or more efficient, but this seems to be what 
      works best for me right now.  Maybe devote some time this week to 
      learning how to write more complete/thorough psuedocode?  I just feel
      like this is kinda lackluster!  
  
   2. I really, really, REALLY need to make some good developer friends
      to talk to.  No one to bounce ideas off of SUCKS.  Took me ~16 hours of
      research and testing, not including reading and lectures, to finally
      figure something out that seems like it works, and even then, not
      as efficiently as I'd like.  Gotta get faster!  
  
   3. Using strlen seems so inefficient.  I know there must be better ways
      to do what I want to do here.  And what the fuck is up with the insane
      difficulty of checking length of long longs and arrays in c?  That shit 
      was ridiculously tedious and got me NOWHERE.  Maybe I was just approaching
      this problem from the wrong direction initially (and misunderstood the 
      necessary Luhn algorithm at first), but for other applications, that still
      seems pretty ridiculous. 
   
   4. Holy fuck, that took me like 16 hours and I have three hours left to 
      finish mario.  Fuck fuck fuck!  It's go time!
